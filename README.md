eulerian: This project was made in PROMYS 2018 to generate data for q-Eulerian polynomials proposed by Paul Gunnells (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02446.pdf). See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07398.pdf Definition 2.3, 2.6 for algorithm, also Appendix A for data. As there is no previously known efficient way to generate q-Eulerian polynomials, this program is able to generate data for n=10 with given data restraints, allowing us to make important conjectures about the properties of these polynomials.
