Welcome to my MIT Maker Portfolio!

The following gives a brief description of each of the codes:

PROMYS q-Eulerian Polynomial Data Generator-
eulerian: This project was made in PROMYS 2018 to generate data for q-Eulerian polynomials proposed by Paul Gunnells (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02446.pdf). See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07398.pdf Definition 2.3, 2.6 for algorithm, also Appendix A for data. As there is no previously known efficient way to generate q-Eulerian polynomials, this program is able to generate data for n=10 with given data restraints, allowing us to make important conjectures about the properties of these polynomials and ultimately allowing us to derive a new formula for these polynomials.


CIFARtest is a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the CIFAR100 dataset. Final commented accuracies are ran on 10 epochs each.

IMPORTANT: when running these three programs, change the paths, as they save the best model for test and validation.
